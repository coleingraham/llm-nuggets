# Filtering Chat History

One of the challenges with LLMs is dealing with long contexts. As the
length of the chat history increases, the cost of each request increases,
and you run into the [lost in the middle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172)
problem, degrading performance. A simple technique for managing this is to
just send the previous few messages as context in a long chat. This obviously
has limitations, so in practice it should be paired with other techniques,
but it's fairly straightforward to implement.

# Example Usage

```
$ cd src
$ python filtered_history.py --provider ollama --model qwen3:8b --temperature 0.3
