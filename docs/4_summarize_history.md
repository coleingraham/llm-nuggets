# Chat History Summarization

Building on top of the [filtered history example](2_filtered_history.md),
we generally need something more than just omitting previous messages. One
extension to this is to create a summary of the important information in the
chat history, and then provide that along with the most recent messages.

# Example Usage

```
$ cd src
$ python -m oop.summarize_history --provider ollama --model qwen3:8b --temperature 0.3

 AIMessage(content='Squaring a circle is a classic geometric problem that has been a subject of fascination and mathematical inquiry for centuries. The goal of the problem is to construct a square with the same area as a given circle, using only a compass and straightedge. However, this task is mathematically impossible under the classical constraints of Euclidean geometry.\n\n### Why is it impossible?\nThe problem was proven to be impossible in 1882 by the German mathematician **Ferdinand von Lindemann**, who showed that **œÄ (pi)** is a **transcendental number**. A transcendental number is not a root of any non-zero polynomial equation with rational coefficients. This means that it is impossible to construct a square with the same area as a given circle using only a compass and straightedge, because such a construction would require the exact value of œÄ, which cannot be achieved through these classical tools.\n\n### What does this mean for practical purposes?\nWhile it is impossible to "square a circle" in the classical geometric sense, there are several ways to approach the problem in different contexts:\n\n1. **Approximate Solutions**: You can approximate a square with the same area as a circle by using numerical methods or approximations of œÄ. For example, if the radius of the circle is $ r $, the area is $ \\pi r^2 $, and the side length of the square would be $ \\sqrt{\\pi} r $.\n\n2. **Modern Tools**: With the help of modern computational tools or software (like GeoGebra, CAD programs, or even a calculator), you can construct a square with an area very close to that of a given circle.\n\n3. **Symbolic Representation**: In symbolic mathematics, you can represent the square with an area equal to that of a circle using the expression $ s = r\\sqrt{\\pi} $, where $ s $ is the side length of the square and $ r $ is the radius of the circle.\n\n4. **Historical and Philosophical Interest**: The problem has also been of interest in philosophy and mathematics as a symbol of the limits of human knowledge and the nature of infinity.\n\n### Summary\n- **Classical (Euclidean) Geometry**: Impossible.\n- **Modern Mathematics**: Can be approximated or represented symbolically.\n- **Practical Use**: You can construct a square with an area very close to that of a circle using numerical methods or technology.\n\nLet me know if you\'d like help with a specific approximation or calculation!', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}),
