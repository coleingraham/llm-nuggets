# Chat History Summarization

Building on top of the [filtered history example](2_filtered_history.md),
we generally need something more than just omitting previous messages. One
extension to this is to create a summary of the important information in the
chat history, and then provide that along with the most recent messages.

# Example Usage

```
$ cd src
$ python summarize_history.py --provider ollama --model qwen3:8b --temperature 0.3

 AIMessage(content="Squaring a circle is a classic geometric problem that has intrigued mathematicians for centuries. The goal is to construct a square with the same area as a given circle using only a compass and straightedge. However, this task is mathematically impossible under the traditional rules of classical geometry.\n\n### Why is it impossible?\nThe problem was proven to be impossible in 1882 by the German mathematician **Ferdinand von Lindemann**, who showed that **œÄ (pi)** is a **transcendental number**. This means that œÄ cannot be the root of any non-zero polynomial equation with rational coefficients. Since constructing a square with the same area as a circle would require solving such an equation, it's fundamentally impossible with compass and straightedge alone.\n\n### What does this mean for practical purposes?\n- **In theory**: Squaring the circle is impossible under classical geometric constraints.\n- **In practice**: You can approximate it using modern tools or numerical methods. For example:\n  - Calculate the area of the circle: $ A = \\pi r^2 $\n  - Find the side length of the square: $ s = \\sqrt{A} = \\sqrt{\\pi r^2} = r \\sqrt{\\pi} $\n  - Use this side length to construct a square with approximately the same area as the circle.\n\n### Summary\n- **Impossible with compass and straightedge** (classical geometry).\n- **Possible with modern tools or approximations**.\n\nLet me know if you'd like help calculating the side length of a square with the same area as a given circle! üìêüìê", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}),
